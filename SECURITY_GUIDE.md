### 4. **Configure Security** 🔧
Edit `lib/dradis/plugins/user_issue_stats/configuration.rb`:

```ruby
# For maximum security (admin-only):
REQUIRE_ADMIN_ROLE = true

# For restricted access:
REQUIRE_ADMIN_ROLE = false # Team leads and above

# For performance in large environments:
MAX_ISSUES_TO_PROCESS = 5000
```

### 5. **Test Access** ✅
1. Login as regular user - should see only their accessible projects
2. Login as admin - should see all projects
3. Test date filtering with various ranges
4. Verify no unauthorized data exposure

- `UserIssueStats Error:` - Processing errors
- `Access denied:` - Permission violations
- `Error parsing` - Data parsing issues

### Performance Monitoring:
- Page load times should be < 3 seconds
- Memory usage should remain stable
- No database lock issues

## Emergency Procedures:

### If Issues Occur:
1. **Disable Plugin**: Comment out gem in Gemfile
